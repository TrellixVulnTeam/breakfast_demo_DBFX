# breakfast_demo

- Examples like **SearchL2 + AskL1 + ProvL1** seems to work.
- I've added a few more breakfast words in esDict.
  -  Right now it only words with single words (milk, coffee, etc) but it could be interesting to add sentences like 'a glass of milk', for example.
- Would it be possible to cover other ways to ask for the missing word: 'cómo es...' ('how is...'), 'cómo se llama...' ('how is ... called' / 'what is the name...').
